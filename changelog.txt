  Features:
    - Added setting to change transmitter and receiver sizes between 3x3, 2x2, and 1x1. (Default is 2x2. In the last version, both were 3x3. Changing in an existing save should work, but existing entities will be placed off-grid.)
  Changes:
    - Partially fixed transmitter sprite artifacts created by upscaling; please do not look too closely at it.
    - Increased brightness and contrast of sprite for the Radio tech.
    - Increased brightness of sprites for items/recipes.
